# MinimaListUtils-B4X
Version: 1.80 \
A utility class to manipulate a simple List of Map to do basic CRUD.

Treat it as some kind of a NoSQL for key-value pairs.\
It is suitable for small demo if you don't want to use SQL database.

It depends on **RandomAccessFile** library.\
Note: You can use File.WriteBytes and File.ReadBytes to write to and read from a file.

This b4xlib replaces the class from MinimaList formerly published in B4J code snippet.

Code snippets also included for creating RESTful API subs for MinimaList Controller when developing with Web API Template 2.04+.
